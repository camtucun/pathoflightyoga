<h2> Relax Anytime with Savasana </h2>

<p>
	Prepare youself for Savasana. Lie down on your mat with your arms at your side with palms up. Close your eyes
	<br> and breathe slowly but deeply. Sink into the mat and let your worries slip away. When you are ready, roll on your side 
	<br> and use your arms to push yourself to a sitting position with crossed legs. Place your hands in a prayer position. Be
	<br> grateful for all you have in life. Namaste. </p>
